title: "NFT Batch Reveal"
---

## Objective

In this tutorial, you will use a demo user interface to learn how to use Chainlink Automation to automate batch reveal of NFT mints. The demo includes setting up a Chainlink VRF subscription, funding it, automatically generating a smart contract that will then be used by both VRF (as a consumer) and in Automation (as the target contract). VRF is used for randomizing the metadata for the NFTs and Automation is used to set trigger conditions for when the NFT metadata is revealed via batch size and/or time interval parameters
